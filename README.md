## Script Installation
Installation is very straight forward.  All you have to do is extract and edit the config.php file to suit your needs.  

## Script Setup
Select which system you are going to integrate with.  Then setup the database details.  Once done, you will need to look and see if there are any additional setup details that need to be completed for the system that you are integrating.

## Kayako Setup
Setup kayako using this guide -

It is *HIGHLY* recommended that you use HTTPS for security purposes.
